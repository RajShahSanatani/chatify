## 💡 Overview  

The main idea of this project is to create a platform where:  

- Users can **chat globally** with everyone in the app.  
- Users can **send friend requests** and connect personally.  
- Chat messages are delivered in **real-time** using Socket.io.  
- The app also shows **online/offline status** of users.

- **Authentication** – secure login/signup with MongoDB.  
- **Realtime Updates** – no refresh needed, everything updates live.  
- **Simple UI** – clean design using HTML, CSS, and EJS.
